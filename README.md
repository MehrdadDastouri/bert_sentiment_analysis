# Sentiment Analysis with BERT

This project demonstrates how to use the pre-trained BERT model for sentiment analysis. The model classifies text into two categories: positive and negative.

## Features
- Uses a pre-trained BERT model (`bert-base-uncased`) for text classification.
- Tokenizes and processes text using the BERT tokenizer.
- Fine-tunes the model on a small dataset of labeled text.
- Evaluates the model with precision, recall, and F1-score.
